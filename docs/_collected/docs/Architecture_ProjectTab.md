# Architecture – Project Tab (GUI)

- Generated by R2522
- Time: 20251222_233141

## Purpose
The **Project Tab** is a **read-only orientation dashboard** for the current ShrimpDev project state.

It is **not** the “Project system” itself. The real project truth lives in:
- `docs/PIPELINE.md`
- architecture docs in `docs/`
- reports in `docs/Report_R####_*.md`
- the runner history and backups in `_Archiv/`

## Non-Goals (Hard boundaries)
The Project Tab must **not**:
- introduce new business logic that competes with existing modules
- become a second control center with lots of buttons
- write or modify `MasterRules.md` / `PIPELINE.md` (docs are Runner-only)
- compute “smart decisions” (that belongs to future Agent logic, if any)

## Allowed Inputs (Read-only)
The Project Tab may read:
- `docs/PIPELINE.md` (status snapshot: P0/P1 open, last updates)
- latest reports: `docs/Report_R25xx_*.md` (last runner outputs)
- optional: latest smoke test report (e.g., `Report_R2520_SmokeTest_*`)

## Output / UI Contract (Minimal)
Show only a compact summary, no actions:

1) **Status strip**
- Workspace root
- Last runner id/time (best-effort: parse from latest report filename)
- Last smoke-test: OK/FAIL (best-effort)

2) **Pipeline snapshot**
- P0 open items count
- P1 open items count
- “recently touched” section (best-effort: last N lines or anchors)

3) **Next suggested action (text only)**
- If P0 open → “Recommended: address P0 first (READ-ONLY diagnosis before patches)”
- Else if P1 open → same pattern
- Else → “Stable: no urgent actions”

## Implementation Notes (Future)
- Build in **phases**: first only file reading + rendering.
- No full rewrites; one minimal patch per Runner.
- Each patch must keep `py_compile` green and add a report.

## Risks
- Duplicating truth (GUI shows something different than docs).
Mitigation: keep Project Tab read-only and “best-effort” labeled.
